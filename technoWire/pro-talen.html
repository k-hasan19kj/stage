    <h1>*Introduction: Overview of Programming Languages</h1>
    <p>Programming languages can be categorized into different main groups, each with its unique features and
      applications.
      Understanding these categories is essential to comprehend the evolution of programming languages and appreciate
      their
      impact on the technological world. Below, the key categories are explained:</p>

    <div class="machine">
      <h2>1. Machine Code:</h2>
      <p>Machine code consists of sequences of zeros and ones directly understood by a computer processor. It represents
        the
        most fundamental form of programming and is specific to a particular hardware architecture. An example of
        machine code
        might look like this: 10110000 01100001.</p>
    </div>


    <div class="assembly">
      <h2>2. Assembly Languages (Assembly):</h2>
      <p> Assembly languages are successors to machine code and provide a more human-readable form of programming. These
        languages translate symbolic instructions into the corresponding machine language. An example of assembly code
        could
        look like this:</p>
      <img class="inlei-images" src="hall-images/assembly.jpg">
    </div>
    <div class="high-Level">

      <h2>3. High-Level Programming Languages:</h2>
      <p>High-level programming languages, such as C, Java, and Python, are designed to reduce the complexity of
        programming.
        They use readable syntax and provide abstraction from the underlying hardware. Here's an example of a simple
        program
        in C:</p>
      <img class="inlei-images" src="hall-images/basic-c.jpg">
    </div>

    <div class="fourth">
      <h2>4. Fourth-Generation Languages (4GL):</h2>
      <p>Fourth-generation languages are specialized languages designed for specific tasks, like SQL for databases and
        MATLAB
        for scientific calculations. They enable users to accomplish complex operations with minimal code. An example
        SQL
        query might look like this:</p>
      <img class="inlei-images" src="hall-images/sql.jpeg">
    </div>
    <div class="object">
      <h2>5. Object-Oriented Languages:</h2>
      <p>Object-oriented languages, such as C++ and Java, organize data into objects containing both data and
        associated
        functions. This approach promotes reusability and modularity in the code. Here's an example of a class in Java:

      <p>main categories represent the evolution of programming languages, each with its advantages and
        applications.
        In the following sections, we will explore some of the most influential programming languages within these
        categories and discuss their contributions to the world of computer science.

        <p>Programming Language Name: Ruby (Rails is a web application framework written in Ruby). <br>
          Developer(s): Rails, also known as Ruby on Rails, was extracted by David Heinemeier Hansson from his work on
          the project management tool Basecamp at 37signals (now Basecamp). The framework was first released as
          open-source in July 2004.
        <ul>Specific Features:
          <li>Model-View-Controller (MVC) Architecture: Rails follows the MVC architectural pattern, which separates the
            application logic into three interconnected components: Model (data and business logic), View (user
            interface), and Controller (handles user requests and manages the flow of data).</li>
          <li>Convention over Configuration (CoC): Rails promotes sensible defaults and conventions, reducing the need
            for configuration files. This convention over configuration approach streamlines development and enhances
            consistency among Rails projects.</li>
          <li>Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) Principle: Rails encourages the DRY principle, aiming to eliminate redundancy
